                                I charge per-photo. This means that if you have 2 products and want 4 photos each,
                                you will be charged for 8 photos.

                                The real answer. . .it depends. The biggest factor is how many images you decide to order at
                                the end. Please contact me to have a final cost estimate.

                                Normally, I don't shoot overly large sized products and only stick with small to medium sized products.
                                Let me know the size of your product and I'll see if I can accommodate to it. If I can, there is an
                                extra $10 per image fee.

                                Yes, of course! I encourage that! We can meet at a coffee shop to drop off your product
                                and we can chat in-person about how you specifically want things done.

                                From the time I receive your product, my photoshoot/editing process takes about 5-7 business days.
                                If you have a large number of products or photo requests, this may add to the production time.
                                Please contact me if you want a confirmed date.

                                Each image comes with a solid white/black background (other colors are available upon request).
                                I use coloring grading and enhancement to ensure I am accurately portraying your product in
                                an amazing way. Also, scratches, smudges, and other minor defects will be removed via Photoshop.

                                the natural settings of your product. The cost of props purchased for the lifestyle pictures are added

                                However, if it's from client communication error, the reshoot charges will be added to the end
