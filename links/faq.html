                            do you charge per-photo or per-product?

                                We charge per-photo. This means that if you have 2 products and want 4 photos each,
                                you will be charged for 8 photos.

                                The real answer, it depends. The biggest factor is how many images you decide to order at
                                the end. Please contact us to have a final cost estimation.

                            <div class="answer">
                                Normally, we don't shoot overly large sized products and only stick with small to medium sized products.
                                Let us know in advanced if we can accommodate to your product. If we can, there is an extra $10
                                per image fee.

                                Yes, of course! We encourage that! We can meet at a coffee shop to drop off your product
                                and we can chat in-person about how you specifically want things done.

                                From the time we receive your product, our photoshoot/editing process takes about 5-7 business days.
                                If you have a large number of products or photos requests, this may add to the production time.
                                Please contact us if you want a confirmed date.

                                Each image comes with a solid white/black background (other colors are available upon request).
                                We use coloring grading and enhancement to ensure we are accurately protraying your product in
                                an amazing way. Also, scratches, smudges, and other minor defeats will be removed via Photoshop.
